    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.First_Name__c} {!Account.Last_Name__c},

We want to thank you for your interest in volunteering with Atlas Assistance Dogs.

Unfortunately the results of your background check put us in a position that we cannot have you active in the role we initially considered with Atlas. We would like to talk to you about other possible roles. Please respond back if you are interested.

We look forward to hearing from you and wish you nothing but the best.
