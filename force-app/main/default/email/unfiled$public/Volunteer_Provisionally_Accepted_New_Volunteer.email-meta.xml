    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.FirstName__c} {!Account.LastName__c},

We are excited to let you know we would love to have you volunteer with us.

Please complete the following volunteer forms.

*Emergency Contact Information: https://www.tfaforms.com/4819452

*Volunteer Release : https://www.tfaforms.com/4819457

Once we receive these from you we will give you access to our online courses. These are quick and help you get familiar with Atlas and the world of service dogs and positive training. 

If the role you are doing requires access to sensitive information, once you complete your classes we will send you a background check request. Your ability to volunteer in those roles are contingent on the background check results. 

If no background check is required or once your background check is completed, we will contact you with your account information and connect you with the team(s) you will be working with


As always, let us know any questions.
Thankyou for being part of Atlas!

Best,
Molly and Atlas Assistance Dogs</textOnly>
