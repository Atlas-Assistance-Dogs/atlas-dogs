    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

 

Thank you for reaching out. There are a few options for obtaining/training a service dog. All of which have benefits and drawback: 

 

·         Foundations that train the dog and provide the dog for free (though those can have very long waitlists and may have other type of specific criteria) 

·         Organizations or companies that train the dog fully or partially and provide for a cost or in-kind donation (cost can really vary widely, wait time also varies) 

·         Obtaining your own dog and training on your own (with the help of a private trainer, group classes, books or online resources etc., or an organization like ours)

 

The self-training option need a lot of consideration and is not for everyone. 

 

I have attached a document which gives some information and insight as to if self-training is a good option and what other options may best fit your needs (https://www.atlasdog.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guidelines-to-Self-Training-Approaches.pdf). I recommend you look over this document carefully. 

 

If you were to choose the self-training route, the first step would of course be to find an appropriate dog for service work. Not all dogs are good candidates to become service dogs.

 

Eventually, you may qualify for Atlas’ program. We help people once the dog is at least 14 months old and has a foundation of obedience and can pass our entry assessment test. We then work with the person/dog to really solidify their skills and become great working teams. We support our clients with public access, disability tasks, and day to day needs for the team.  

 

Please let me know if you have any further questions once you have reviewed this document.
