    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},


Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like DOG NAME has been doing some excellent work and  has made great progress, and could very well be ready to start Atlas&apos; program. Unfortunately, we do not have any Team Facilitators at this time who would be able to work hands-on with you. We are expanding our team of Facilitators in new locations across the US and we will hopefully have some more in your area.


I can keep your information, and as soon as we have someone available near you, I will contact you if you are interested!



Let me know if you have any questions.



Best, {!User.FirstName}</textOnly>
